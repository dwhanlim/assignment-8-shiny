This application uses a default data frame installed within RStudio and uses that data set to create a shiny application. The application has very few but simple functions that it can perform. It allows the user to choose between petals and sepals on a flower
then the server uses a function that creates a plotly graph to display its length and width. The user also has another option of choosing the species of the flower instead of just a single species.
